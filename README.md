# Piglet-CMS 

üêΩ This was a CMS that was created by Alan from USAToday back in, idk, 2002? I'm not sure how it came to be found on the internet here in 2022, or nonetheless 5 years prior by @hoanganhnh2009, but here it is, sanitized in all it's glory.  

This CMS was never intended to be the thing it became. It was meant to be a simple way for Alan to manage his workflow, and like any good project, it became much larger than him. Eventually, in 2012, we pitted it against Django and, I think it was, Alfresco, and, well, Piglet did not win. The redesign of USAToday was launched 6 grueling months later in September of 2012. I had very little to do with that project, instead writing the testbed of USAToday+Me, the Facebook app.

I left USAToday/Gannett Digital New Product Development to join Gannett Co. as a Manager of Innovation Projects in 11G. My work 'saving journalism' was done (I didn't do that much, the amazing developers of USAToday and Gannett Digital did the hard work.) I enjoyed New Product Development, and thought the Innovation & Design Group would be a fitting place for me. I was honestly afraid they would disband NPD and make me into a Development (Middle) Manager, which, I didn't want to do. Anyhow, this is not about me.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This CMS is a relic, and remains so, unmaintained otherwise.

Honestly, if this is even the same codebase as the code Alan wrote so long ago, it's not probably worth it to stand it up and make new pages. It probably has security holes, which is probably how it was found anyways. It was written in .Net 2.0 afterall.
